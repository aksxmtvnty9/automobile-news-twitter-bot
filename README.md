## Acknowledgments
* Inspiration - I was lazy to go and view all the brand pages/accounts in twitter, so I created this bot so that I could visit a single page/account to view all the news that I need

* Refereance - I refered [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/easily-set-up-your-own-twitter-bot-4aeed5e61f7f/) freecodecamp blog post to create one for me. A special thanks to [Scott Spence](https://github.com/spences10) for creating this bot and blog post.
